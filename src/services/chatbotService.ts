    {
      question: "what is pancreatic cancer",
      answer: "Pancreatic cancer is a disease where malignant (cancerous) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. It typically has few symptoms in its early stages, which makes early detection challenging. Common symptoms in advanced stages include abdominal pain, jaundice, weight loss, and digestive problems. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, diabetes, family history, and certain genetic conditions. Early detection and treatment significantly improve survival rates."
    },
    {
      question: "what does this result mean",
      answer: "The results show the probability of four pancreatic conditions based on AI analysis of your scan. Higher percentages indicate a greater likelihood of that condition. The colored bars represent risk levels: green for low risk, yellow for moderate risk, and red for higher risk. The heatmap shows areas of concern. Remember that these results should be reviewed by a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, as AI analysis is a screening tool, not a definitive diagnosis."
    },
    {
      question: "how accurate is the ai",
      answer: "Our AI system has been trained on specialized pancreatic imaging datasets and demonstrates high accuracy in detecting patterns associated with pancreatic conditions. However, like all medical AI systems, it has limitations. The accuracy varies by condition and image quality, with typical accuracy ranges of 80-90% for clear presentations of disease. Factors that can affect accuracy include image quality, unusual presentations of disease, and rare variants. This is why we always recommend having the results reviewed by a healthcare professional."
    },
    {
      question: "can i trust this report for medical consultation",
      answer: "While our AI analysis provides valuable insights, it should not replace professional medical advice. The report should be used as a discussion tool with your healthcare provider. Medical imaging interpretation is complex, and AI systems have limitations. Your doctor will consider your complete medical history, symptoms, and possibly additional tests when making a diagnosis. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before making any medical decisions based on these results."
    },
    {
      question: "what is chronic pancreatitis",
      answer: "Chronic pancreatitis is a long-lasting inflammation of the pancreas that alters its normal structure and function. It develops gradually, often after multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis. The condition leads to digestive problems, diabetes, and chronic pain as the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive enzymes and insulin. Common causes include alcoholism, genetic factors, autoimmune conditions, and blockages in the pancreatic duct. Treatment focuses on pain management, enzyme replacement therapy, and lifestyle modifications."
    },
    {
      question: "what are pancreatic cysts",
      answer: "Pancreatic cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the pancreas. While many are benign (non-cancerous), some types can be or become cancerous. Most pancreatic cysts are found incidentally during imaging for other conditions. Different types include serous cystadenomas (rarely become cancerous), mucinous cystic neoplasms (potential to become cancerous), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and pseudocysts (usually from inflammation). Regular monitoring is important, particularly for mucinous cysts which have higher malignancy potential."
    },
    {
      question: "what is acute pancreatitis",
      answer: "Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation of the pancreas that can range from mild discomfort to a life-threatening emergency. Common causes include gallstones, alcohol consumption, certain medications, infections, and trauma. Symptoms typically include severe abdominal pain (often radiating to the back), nausea, vomiting, and fever. Most cases resolve with supportive care including IV fluids, pain management, and fasting, but severe cases can lead to tissue damage, infection, or organ failure. Recurrent episodes may lead to chronic pancreatitis."
    },
    {
      question: "what does the heatmap show",
      answer: "The heatmap overlay highlights areas in your scan that the AI system has identified as potentially abnormal. Warmer colors (red/orange) indicate regions that most strongly influenced the AI's assessment, often corresponding to areas with features associated with disease. These could be areas of inflammation, structural changes, abnormal tissue density, or other concerning characteristics. The heatmap helps visualize where in the pancreas the potential issues are located, which can be valuable information for healthcare professionals during their evaluation."
